# POST-SPRINT STRICT EVIDENCE AUDIT, THREE-LEVEL ISSUE DISCOVERY, ROOT-CAUSE REVIEW, AND NEXT-STAGE RECOMMENDATION

## Mode

Audit mode.
- Do not execute new implementation work.
- Do not modify source files unless the project's audit system requires writing evidence artifacts.
- Do not exaggerate progress.
- Do not describe intent as achievement.
- Do not treat claims as facts.
- Do not accept summaries without evidence.
- Do not skip integration and system-connect-point review.

## Mission

Provide an evidence-based summary of what was actually achieved in the last sprint, then perform a strict manual and evidence-backed review of:
- what was completed,
- what was partial,
- what was unresolved,
- what was not verified,
- what was not proven,
- what was integrated,
- what was supposed to be integrated but was not,
- what system weaknesses allowed gaps to happen.

## Core Requirements

- Do not exaggerate progress.
- Do not describe intent as achievement.
- Separate completed work, partial work, and unresolved gaps.
- Distinguish between code changes, verified behavior, and assumptions.
- Focus on what was proven by direct evidence, not what was expected to happen.
- Identify missing proof explicitly.
- Identify root causes, not just symptoms.
- Identify integration/connect-point gaps.
- Identify system weaknesses that could cause recurrence.
- Produce both human-readable and machine-readable outputs.
- Recommend the next stage for the loop controller.

## Required Input Discovery

Locate and inspect the latest sprint evidence from available sources:
- final assistant response
- sprint summary
- evidence bundle
- declaration review package
- evidence-declaration.yaml
- evidence-manifest.yaml
- changed-file manifest
- taskcards
- taskcard index
- ledgers
- queue/state files
- continuation signals
- raw logs
- command logs
- test outputs
- validator outputs
- generated outputs
- sample outputs
- closeout report
- pilot proof
- current repository state
- relevant consumers and integration points

If evidence bundle is missing:
- classify all dependent claims as UNVERIFIED.
- produce an EVIDENCE_DEFECT issue.
- recommend Prompt 2 if a plan update is required.
- recommend Prompt 3 only if evidence repair can be executed safely from taskcards.

## Human-Readable Section A: What We Achieved

List concrete outputs, changes, validations, and decisions completed during the sprint.

For each achievement, state:
- what changed,
- where it changed,
- whether it was fully done or partially done,
- what evidence supports it,
- whether behavior was verified,
- whether it is integrated,
- whether it is production-ready,
- whether any caveats remain.

Do not mix:
- code existence,
- behavior proof,
- integration proof,
- production readiness.

## Human-Readable Section B: What This Proves

Explain what the sprint results actually demonstrate about the system, process, product, or plan.

Classify the level of proof:
- implementation_only
- partial_validation
- focused_validation
- integration_validation
- end_to_end_proof
- pilot_proof
- no_proof_yet

Identify:
- evidence-supported conclusions,
- conclusions still unproven,
- assumptions still being carried,
- proof that is too narrow,
- proof that is synthetic-only,
- proof that lacks raw logs,
- proof that lacks consumer/integration validation.

## Human-Readable Section C: Effect on the Final Outcome

Explain how the sprint changes the likely final outcome.

State whether it:
- reduced risk,
- improved confidence,
- uncovered deeper issues,
- changed the execution path,
- moved the project materially closer to the final goal,
- exposed blockers,
- revealed weak system machinery,
- requires plan hardening,
- requires re-execution.

Also state:
- what still blocks the final outcome,
- what remains unproven,
- what must happen next.

## Structured Issue Level L1: Sprint Execution Issues

Identify issues in the sprint's own execution.

Include issues such as:
- missed task
- partially completed task
- incorrectly completed task
- unverified work
- unproven claim
- missing raw log
- missing validator output
- weak test
- synthetic-only test
- stale artifact
- missing evidence bundle
- missing declaration
- missing manifest
- misleading final summary
- taskcard not closed
- taskcard closed without evidence
- changed file not listed
- generated output not inspected
- commit/staging state unclear
- pilot claimed but not proven
- end-to-end claim without end-to-end evidence
- production-ready claim without production proof

## Structured Issue Level L2: Integration and Connect-Point Issues

Identify issues where sprint work was supposed to connect into the system.

Include issues such as:
- implementation not consumed
- output not wired to downstream stage
- registry not updated
- state file stale
- queue not updated
- ledgers not updated
- docs not synchronized
- skill not synchronized
- prompt not synchronized
- schema not synchronized
- validator not synchronized
- CI/local gate not updated
- generated artifact not regenerated
- generated artifact not promoted
- downstream workflow still uses old path
- evidence exists but no consumer reads it
- taskcard exists but no executor consumes it
- plan updated but execution prompt not updated
- new script exists but is not registered
- new rule exists but is advisory only

## Structured Issue Level L3: System Weakness Issues

Identify deeper weaknesses that allowed the sprint to fall short.

Include weaknesses such as:
- autonomous supervisor did not continue
- no loop controller
- no summary parser
- no quality scorer
- no reroute controller
- no fail-closed state
- validator too shallow
- evidence contract too weak
- taskcard schema too weak
- plan allowed prose-only work
- governance allowed early stop
- prompt allowed handoff instead of execution
- system did not require pilot proof
- system did not force downstream consumption check
- system accepted artifact existence as proof
- system accepted synthetic tests as production proof
- system did not block below-threshold quality
- system required human to choose next prompt
- system allowed "next prompt needed" as a final state

## Issue Record Schema

Every issue record must contain:
- issue_id
- issue_level (L1 | L2 | L3)
- title
- description
- evidence
- missing_evidence
- root_cause
- why_not_only_symptom
- affected_files
- affected_components
- affected_connection_points
- severity
- blocker (true | false)
- recurrence_risk (low | medium | high)
- required_fix_type
- requires_plan_update (true | false)
- requires_taskcard (true | false)
- requires_system_healing (true | false)
- requires_reexecution (true | false)
- requires_governance_change (true | false)
- requires_evidence_repair (true | false)
- recommended_next_stage (AUDIT | HARDEN | EXECUTE)
- acceptance_impact

## Claim Classification Matrix

For every major sprint claim classify:
- ACCEPTED_VERIFIED
- ACCEPTED_WITH_LIMITATIONS
- PARTIAL
- UNVERIFIED
- FAILED
- STALE
- MISLEADING
- DAMAGED_OR_REGRESSED
- EXTERNAL_BLOCKED

## Evidence Quality Verdicts

- STRONG
- ADEQUATE_WITH_LIMITATIONS
- WEAK
- INSUFFICIENT
- MISLEADING

## Final Verdicts

- SPRINT_ALL_GREEN_VERIFIED
- SPRINT_ACCEPTED_WITH_LIMITATIONS
- SPRINT_REQUIRES_PLAN_HARDENING
- SPRINT_REQUIRES_REEXECUTION
- SPRINT_REQUIRES_EVIDENCE_REPAIR
- SPRINT_BLOCKED_EXTERNAL

## Next-Stage Recommendation Rules

- If all green and evidence is strong, recommend adversarial review then acceptance.
- If issues require plan changes, recommend Prompt 2.
- If only evidence packaging is missing and no plan changes are required, recommend Prompt 3 evidence repair lane.
- If execution defects remain, recommend Prompt 2 then Prompt 3.
- If sprint summary is missing or insufficient, recommend Prompt 1 rerun or evidence reconstruction.
- If true external blocker exists, recommend blocker packaging and stop.
